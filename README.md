## Introduction
This project is for my DGM3790 course at UVU. This React app will eventually display data for countries around the world. So far, things are super basic.

## Features
- Imports a ton of information about different countries from a local JSON file
- Dynamically creates information cards usning a combination of custom components and components from @material-ui/core
- There's over 200 different countries in here, so it dynamically breaks the cards up into rows of 3 to help keep things nice and orderly
- For now, each card only shows each country's name, subregion and region, but more information will be used later on

## Future Stuff
Down the road, I had the idea of maybe breaking the list out into different expandable sections by region or continent. Alphabetical order is great and all, but it's pretty unwieldy and can be a pain to navigate.

I'll also be adding more than super basic CSS to the cards. I actually do like the simplicity of them right now, but I think there's more that can be done to make things easier to look at.
